# Emlyn's IPython Notebooks

A collection of ipython notebooks that I've authored for demonstration and presentation purposes.

## List of presentations

### (2014) Python as an alternative to MATLAB in life sciences; transliterating your experiments and interfacing hardware.

A talk on moving experiments that you write in MATLAB to the Python scientific
stack, [here is the notebook](./matlab_to_python/matlab_to_python.ipynb)

[PyDataLondon Celebratory First Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/events/179396812/)

### (2017) Analysing the ElectroCardioGram (ECG)

A talk on how to analyse the ECG with Python, [here is the notebook](./analysing_ecg/analysing_ecg.ipynb)

It was presented at PyData London 2017, [here is the YouTube video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyjGCEWU4zY).

### (2024) Protein folding and what it means for drug discovery

This talk will give you just enough background to understand what proteins are, how therapeutic outcomes occur when you interact with them
and Python and it's libraries can be used to discover new drugs. We'll make reference to AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3, but mostly focus on
the practical aspect of how to analyse proteins in python with libraries such biopython, dockstring, rdkit, autodock vina and pymol (all
open-source) and how that could be used to find drugs.

[Here is the notebook](./protein_folding_drug_discovery/protein_folding_drug_discovery.ipynb). It was
presented at PyData London 2024, [here is the YouTube video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H5Xywx0Hz8).
